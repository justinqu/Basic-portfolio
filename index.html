                If asked me a few years ago what I wanted to be I would not have been able to give 
                you a deninite answer. Fortunately, I have been interested in technology and people for as 
                long as I remember. This lead me to study Information Management at Syracuse University. The experience with Syracuse is never ending.
                My connections there have allowed me to learn and grow.

                   I have been lucky to land in Columbia University's Full Stack Development Course.
                   This experience has been challenging so far, but i hope to take everything that I have learned to be a successful Project Manager or Consultant.
